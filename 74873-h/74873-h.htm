<p>Bohemia, o'er thy unatlassed borders
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many cross, with half-reluctant feet,
<BR>And unformed fears of dangers and disorders,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To find delights, more wholesome and more sweet
<BR>Than ever yet were known to the "elite."
<p>Herein can dwell no pretense and no seeming;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No stilted pride thrives in this atmosphere,
<BR>Which stimulates a tendency to dreaming.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The shores of the ideal world, from here,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem sometimes to be tangible and near.
<p>We have no use for formal codes of fashion;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No "Etiquette of Courts" we emulate;
<BR>We know it needs sincerity and passion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry out the plans of God, or fate;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not strive to seem inanimate.
<p>We call no time lost that we give to pleasure;
<BR>Life's hurrying river speeds to Death's great sea;
<BR>We cast out no vain plummet-line to measure
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagined depths of that unknown To Be,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But grasp the Now, and fill it full of glee.
<p>All creeds have room here, and we all together
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Devoutly worship at Art's sacred shrine;
<BR>But he who dwells once in thy golden weather,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bohemia--sweet, lovely land of mine--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can find no joy outside thy border-line.
<H3><A ID="PENALTY">PENALTY.</A></H3>
<p>Because of the fullness of what I had
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I have seems void and vain.
<BR>If I had not been happy I were not sad;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my salt is savorless, why complain?
<p>From the ripe perfection of what was mine,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All that is mine seems worse than naught;
<BR>Yet I know as I sit in the dark and pine,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No cup could be drained which had not been fraught.
<p>From the throb and thrill of a day that was,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The day that now is seems dull with gloom;
<BR>Yet I bear its dullness and darkness because
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis but the reaction of glow and bloom.
<p>From the royal feast which of old was spread
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am starved on the diet which now is mine;
<BR>Yet I could not turn hungry from water and bread,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had not been sated on fruit and wine.
<H3><A ID="LIFE">LIFE.</A></H3>
<p>An infant wailing in nameless fear;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow, perchance, in the quiet room,
<BR>Or the hum of an insect flying near.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the screech-owl's cry, in the outer gloom.
<p>A little child on the sun-checked floor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A broken toy, and a tear-stained face,
<BR>A young life clouded, a young heart sore;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great clock, time, ticks on apace.
<p>A maiden weeping in bitter pain.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white hands clasped on an aching brow.
<BR>A blighted faith and a fond hope slain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A shattered trust and a broken vow.
<p>A matron holding a baby's shoe.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot tears gather, and fall at will
<BR>On the knotted ribbon of white and blue,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the foot that wore it is cold and still.
<p>An aged woman upon her bed,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn, and wearied, and poor and old,
<BR>Longing to rest with the happy dead.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the story of life is told.
<p>Where is the season of careless glee?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the moment that holds no pain?
<BR>Life has its crosses from infancy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the grave; and its hopes are vain.
<H3><A ID="MAURINE">LINES FROM "MAURINE."</A></H3>
<p>I'd  rather have my verses win
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A place in common peoples' hearts,
<BR>Who, toiling through the strife and din
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life's great thoroughfares, and marts,
<p>May read some line my hand has penned;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some simple verse, not fine, or grand,
<BR>But what their hearts can understand
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold me henceforth as a friend,--
<p>I'd rather win such quiet fame
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than by some fine thought, polished so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But those of learned minds would know,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what the meaning of my song,--
<BR>To have the critics sound my name
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In high-flown praises, loud and long.
<p>I sing not for the critic's ear,
<BR>But for the masses. If they hear,
<BR>Despite the turmoil, noise and strife
<BR>Some least low note that gladdens life,
<BR>I shall be wholly satisfied,
<BR>Though critics to the end deride.
<H3><A ID="WHEN">WHEN.</A></H3>
<p>I dwell in the western inland,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Afar from the sounding sea,
<BR>But I seem to hear it sobbing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And calling aloud to me,
<BR>And my heart cries out for the ocean
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a child for its mother's breast,
<BR>And I long to lie on its waters
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And be lulled in its arms to rest.
<p>I can close my eyes and fancy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That I hear its mighty roar,
<BR>And I see its blue waves splashing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And plunging against the shore;
<BR>And the white foam caps the billow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea-gulls wheel and cry,
<BR>And the cool wild wind is blowing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ships go sailing by.
<p>Oh, wonderful, mighty ocean!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When shall I ever stand,
<BR>Where my heart has gone already,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There on thy gleaming strand I
<p>When shall I ever wander
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from this inland west,
<BR>And stand by thy side, dear ocean,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And rock on thy heaving breast?
<H3><A id="ONLYDREAMS">ONLY DREAMS.</A></H3>
<p>A maiden sat in the sunset glow
<BR>Of the shadowy, beautiful Long Ago,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That we see through a mist of tears.
<BR>She sat and dreamed, with lips apart,
<BR>With thoughtful eyes and a beating heart,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the mystical future years;
<BR>And brighter far than the sunset skies
<BR>Was the vision seen by the maiden's eyes.
<p>There were castles built of the summer air,
<BR>And beautiful voices were singing there,
<BR>In a soft and floating strain.
<BR>There were skies of azure and fields or green,
<BR>With never a cloud to come between,
<BR>And never a thought of pain;
<BR>There was music, sweet as the silvery notes
<BR>That flow from a score of thrushes' throats.
<p>There were hands to clasp with a loving hold;
<BR>There were lips to kiss, and eyes that told
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;More than the lips could say.
<BR>And all of the faces she loved were there,
<BR>With their snowy brows untouched by care,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And locks that were never gray.
<BR>And Love was the melody each heart beat,
<BR>And the beautiful vision was all complete.
<p>But the castles built of the summer wind
<BR>I have vainly sought. I only find
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows, all grim and cold;--
<BR>For I was the maiden who thought to see
<BR>Into the future years,-Ah, me!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am gray and old.
<BR>My dream of earth was as fair and bright
<BR>As my hope of heaven is to-night.
<p>Dreams are but dreams at the very best,
<BR>And the friends I loved lay down to rest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With their faces hid away.
<BR>They had furrowed brows and snowy hair,
<BR>And they willingly laid their burdens where
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine shall be laid one day.
<BR>A shadow came over my vision scene
<BR>As the clouds of sorrow came in between.
<p>The hands that I thought to clasp are crossed,
<BR>The lips and the beautiful eyes are lost,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I seek them all in vain.
<BR>The gushes of melody, sweet and clear,
<BR>And the floating voices, I do not hear,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But only a sob of pain;
<BR>And the beating hearts have paused to rest,
<BR>Ah! dreams are but dreams at the very best.
<H3><A ID="NIGHT">"IN THE NIGHT."</A></H3>
<p>In the silent midnight watches,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the earth was wrapped in gloom,
<BR>And the grim and awful darkness
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept unbidden to my room,
<BR>On the solemn, deathly stillness
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the night there broke a sound
<BR>Like ten million wailing voices,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying loudly from the ground.
<p>From ten million graves, came voices
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;East and west and north and south.
<BR>Leagues apart, and yet together
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake they, e'en as with one mouth.
<BR>"Men and women, men and women,"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried these voices from the ground,
<BR>And the very earth was shaken
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strange and awful sound.
<p>"Ye who weep in selfish sorrow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who laugh in selfish mirth,
<BR>Hark! and listen for a moment
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the voices from the earth.
<BR>Wake, and listen, ye who slumber.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause, and listen, ye who feast,
<BR>To the warning of the voices
<BR>From the graves in west and east.
<p>"We, the victims of a demon,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We, who one, and each, and all,
<BR>Can cry out before high Heaven,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are slain by Alcohol.
<BR>We would warn you, youths and maidens,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the path that we have trod.
<BR>From the path that leads to ruin,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And away from Peace and God.
<p>"We, the millions who have fallen,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Warn you from the ruddy glow
<BR>Of the wine in silver goblets,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For destruction lies below,
<BR>Wine and gin, and rum and brandy,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whiskey, cider, ale and beer:
<BR>These have slain us, and destroyed us--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;These the foes that brought us here.
<p>"You are safe, you say? ah, Heaven!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So we said, and drank, and died,
<BR>We are safe, we proudly boasted,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we sunk down in the tide.
<BR>There is never any safety
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the snares of Alcohol,
<BR>For the youth who looks on liquor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tastes, or handles it at all.
<p>"We beseech you, men and women,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fathers, Mothers, Husbands, Wives,
<BR>To arise and slay the demon
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That is threatening dear one's lives.
<BR>Do not preach of moderation
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To your children, for alas!
<BR>There is not a foe more subtle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the fateful Social Glass.
<p>"Thoughtless mother, wife or sister,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dash that poison cup away!
<BR>He, the husband, son, or brother,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who so gaily sips to-day,
<BR>May to-morrow stagger homeward,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeered and scorned by sober men.
<BR>Would you smile upon him proudly--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you say 'I did it'-then?
<p>"Ah! a vast and mighty number
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the drunkards in all lands
<BR>Take the first step to destruction
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by white and fragile hands.
<BR>Every smile you give the wine-cup,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every glance, oh lady fair,
<BR>Like a spade digs down, and hollows
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Out a drunkard's grave, somewhere.
<p>"Men in office, men in power:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you let this demon wild
<BR>Stalk unfettered through the nation,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaying woman, man, and child?
<BR>Oh, arouse, ye listless mortals!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is work for every one!
<BR>We have warned you of your danger;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spoken-we have done!"
<p>Round about me fell the silence
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the solemn night, once more,
<BR>And I heard the quiet ticking
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the clock outside my door.
<BR>It was not a dreamer's fancy--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a romance of my brain
<BR>But the warning of the victims
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That Old Alcohol had slain.
<H3><A id="CONTENTMENT">CONTENTMENT.</A></H3>
<p>If any line that I ever penned,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or any word I have spoken,
<BR>Has comforted heart, of foe or friend--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In any way, why my life, I'll say
<BR>Has reaped the reward of labor.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If aught I have said, or written, has made
<BR>Gladder the heart o' my neighbor.
<p>If any deed that I ever did
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightened a sad heart's sorrow,
<BR>If I have lifted a drooping lid
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the bright to-morrow,
<BR>Though the world knows not, nor gives me a thought,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever can know, nor praise me.
<BR>Yet still I shall say, to my heart alway,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That my life, and labor repays me.
<p>If in any way I have helped a soul,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or given a spirit pleasure,
<BR>Then my cup of joy, I shall think is full
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With an overflowing measure.
<BR>Though never an eye, but the one on high
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks on my kindly action,
<BR>Yet, oh my heart, we shall think of our part
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;in the drama, with satisfaction.
<H3><A id="LAKECITY">A NEW YEAR'S GREETING TO THE CITY OF THE LAKES.</A></H3>
<p>I said "I will write a greeting,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the City of the Lakes,
<BR>Write, while the city sleepeth,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing it when it wakes.
<p>"To this fair, and blessed city,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the glad New Year doth bring
<BR>Its best, and its sweetest treasure,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its choicest offering.
<p>"It brings to our joyful Nation,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The boon of Peace again,
<BR>The fields are white, not scarlet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the death-blood of the slain.
<p>"And not with the sounds of sobbing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we usher in the year,
<BR>Not with hand clasps, and partings,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But with goodly mirth and cheer.
<p>"And brother shall meet with brother,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In peace, from North to South,
<BR>And 'I wish you a happy New Year,'
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall echo from mouth to mouth.
<p>"And there shall be feast, and revel,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In many a home, to-day,
<BR>(God grant that the wine be banished
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From every board away.)
<p>"Thank God for his righteous goodness,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For a land not red with strife
<BR>Thank God for the New Year's blessing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God for the boon of life.
<p>"Oh! beautiful white-robed city,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Asleep in the arms of Lakes,
<BR>I write me a song while it slumbers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'!! sing me a song when it wakes."
<p>And thus while I dreamed, and pondered,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the glad song I would sing,
<BR>Lo! I saw the sun was rising,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And my muse had taken wing.
<H3><A id="LOSS">MOTHER'S LOSS.</A></H3>
<p>If I could clasp my little babe
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my breast to-night,
<BR>I would not mind the blowing wind
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That shrieketh in affright.
<BR>Oh, my lost babe! my little babe,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My babe with dreamful eyes;
<BR>Thy bed is cold; and night wind bold
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrieks woeful lullabies.
<p>My breast is softer than the sod;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;This room, with lighter hearth,
<BR>Is better place for thy sweet face
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than frozen mother earth.
<BR>Oh, my babe! oh, my lost babe!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, babe with waxen hands.
<BR>I want thee so, I need thee so--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Come from thy mystic lands!
<p>No love that, like a mother's, fills
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each corner of the heart;
<BR>No loss like hers, that rends, and chills,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears the soul apart.
<BR>Oh, babe--my babe, my helpless babe!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss thy little form.
<BR>Would I might creep where thou dost sleep,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And clasp thee through the storm.
<p>I hold thy pillow to my breast,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring a vague relief;
<BR>I sing the songs that soothed thy rest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! no cheating grief.
<BR>My breathing babe! my sobbing babe!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss thy plaintiff moan,
<BR>I cannot hear--thou art not near
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My little one, my own.
<p>Thy father sleeps. He mourns thy loss,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But little fathers know
<BR>The pain that makes a mother toss
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sleepless nights of woe.
<BR>My clinging babe! my nursing babe!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;What knows thy father-man--
<BR>How my breasts miss thy lips soft kiss
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;None but a mother can.
<BR>Worn out, I sleep; I wake--I weep
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sleep--hush, hush, my dear;
<BR>Sweet lamb, fear not--Oh, God! I thought--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought my babe was here.
<H3><A id="WOMEN">THE WOMEN.</A></H3>
<p>See the women--pallid women, of our land!
<BR>See them fainting, dying, dead, on every hand!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;See them sinking 'neath a weight
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more burdensome than Fate
<BR>Ever placed upon poor human beings' backs.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;See them falling as they go--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;By their own hands burdened so--
<BR>Paling, failing, sighing, dying, on their tracks!
<p>See the women--ghastly women, on the streets!
<BR>With their corset-tortured waists, and pinched up feet!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts and lungs all out of place,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whalebone forms devoid of grace;
<BR>Faces pallid, robbed of Nature's rosy bloom;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Purple-lidded eyes that tell,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With a language known too well,
<BR>Of the sick-room, death-bed, coffin, pall and tomb.
<p>See the women--sickly women, everywhere,
<BR>See the cruel, killing dresses that they wear!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing round those pounds of jet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you wonder that they fret,
<BR>Pale, and pine, and fall the victims of decay?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it strange the blooming maid,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All so soon should droop and fade--
<BR>Like a beast of burden burdened, day on day?
<p>See the women and their dresses as they go,
<BR>Trimmed and retrimmed, line on line and row on row;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging over fragile hips,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving color from the lips,
<BR>Dragging down their foolish wearers to the grave!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide, and nothing less,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this awful style of dress!
<BR>Who shall rise to women's rescue, who shall save?
<p>See the women--foolish women, dying fast;
<BR>What have all their trimmed-up dresses brought at last?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Worry, pain, disease and death,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss of bloom and gasping breath;
<BR>Doctors' bill, and golden hours thrown away.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They have bartered off for these

<BR>All to ape the fleeting fashion of a day.
<H3><A id="HIGHER">LEAN DOWN AND LIFT ME HIGHER.</A></H3>
<p>Lean down and lift me higher, Josephine;
<BR>From the Eternal Hills hast thou not seen;
<BR>How I do strive for heights? but lacking wings,
<BR>I cannot grasp at once those better things,
<BR>To which I in my inmost soul aspire,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lean down and lift me higher.
<p>I grope along--not desolate or sad,
<BR>For youth and hope and health all keep me glad;
<BR>But too bright sunlight sometimes makes us blind,
<BR>And I do grope for heights I cannot find;
<BR>Oh, thou must know my one supreme desire.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lean down and lift me higher.
<p>Not long ago we trod the selfsame way;
<BR>Thou knewest how, from day to fleeting day;
<BR>Our souls were vexed with trifles, and our feet
<BR>Were lured aside to by-paths which seemed sweet,
<BR>But only served to hinder and to tire.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lean down and lift me higher.
<p>Thou hast gone onward to the heights serene
<BR>And left me here, my loved one, Josephine.
<BR>I am content to stay until the end,
<BR>For life is full of promise; but, my friend,
<BR>Canst thou not help me in my best desire?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;   O! lean, and lift me higher.
<p>Frail as thou wert, thou hast grown strong and wise,
<BR>And quick to understand and sympathize
<BR>With all a full soul's needs.  It must be so;
<BR>Thy year with God hath made thee great, I know.
<BR>Thou must see how I struggle and aspire;
<BR>Oh, warm me with a breath of heavenly fire.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And lean and lift me higher.
<H3><A id="VINNIE">A TRIBUTE TO VINNIE REAM.</A></H3>
<p>All hail to Vinnie Ream!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisconsin's artist daughter,
<BR>Who stands to-day crowned with the fame
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her noble work has brought her.
<BR>Lift up your brows, hills of the West,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell the winds the story,
<BR>How she, our fairest, and our best,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has climbed the heights of glory.
<p>Three cheers for Vinnie Ream!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fought with tribulation,
<BR>And brought from death, to lasting life,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The martyr of our Nation.
<BR>Oh, Spite and Envy, flee in shame!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide your head, black Malice!
<BR>She sips, to-day, the sweets of Fame,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From Fame's emblazoned chalice.
<p>Thank God for Vinnie Ream!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The peerless Badger maiden,
<BR>Who stands a nation's pride, to-day
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With a nation's honors laden.
<BR>Ay! crown her Queen at every feast,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And strew her path with flowers,
<BR>Ye people of the South and East,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember, she is ours!
<p>Bring gifts to Vinnie Ream!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no gift to offer,
<BR>Only a little gift of song,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And that I humbly proffer;--
<BR>Only this little gift to lay
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Columbia's daughter,
<BR>Who stands crowned with the fame, to-day,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That her noble work has brought her.
<H3><A id="LITTLEBIRD">THE LITTLE BIRD.</A></H3>
<p>The father sits in his lonely room,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside sings a little bird.
<BR>But the shadows are laden with death and gloom,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the song is all unheard.
<BR>The father's heart is the home of sorrow;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;His breast is the seat of grief!
<BR>Who will hunt the paper for him on the morrow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will bring him sweet relief
<BR>From wearing thought with innocent chat?
<BR>Who will find his slippers and bring his hat?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the little bird sings
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And flutters her wings;
<BR>The refrain of her song is, "God knows best!
<BR>He giveth his little children rest."
<BR>What can she know of these sorrowful things?
<p>The mother sits by the desolate hearth,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And weeps o'er a vacant chair.
<BR>Sorrow has taken the place of mirth
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy has resigned to despair.
<BR>Bitter the cup the mother is drinking,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So bitter the tear-drops start.
<BR>Sad are the thoughts the mother is thinking--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, they will break her heart.
<BR>Who will run on errands, and romp and play,
<BR>And mimic the robins the livelong day?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the little bird sings
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And flutters her wings;
<BR>"God reigns in heaven, and He will keep
<BR>The dear little children that fall asleep."
<BR>What can she know of these sorrowful things?
<p>Grandmother sits by the open door,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And her tears fall down like rain.
<BR>Was there ever a household so sad before,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it ever be glad again?
<BR>Many unwelcome thoughts come flitting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the granddame's mind.
<BR>Who will take up the stitches she drops in knitting?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will her snuff-box find?
<BR>Who'!! bring her glasses, and wheel her chair,
<BR>And tie her kerchief, and comb her hair?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the little bird sings
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And flutters her wings;
<BR>"God above doeth all things well,
<BR>I sang it the same when my nestlings fell."
<BR>Ah! this knows the bird of these sorrowful things.

<p>I have lingered many years,

<BR>Do not weep because you know

<BR>I am very glad to go,

<p>I have loved you, oh, so long,

<BR>That my love was wild and wrong,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrequited, hopeless, vain;
<BR>Was it weak, unwomanly,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to shrine you in my heart?
<BR>Oh! I struggled frantically--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade your image to depart.
<p>There are hearts that love will pierce,

<BR>Such as mine burns long and fierce,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the heart is cold and still,

<H3><A id="KINGSIREN">THE KING AND SIREN.</A></H3>
<p>The harsh king--Winter--sat upon the hills,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And reigned, and ruled the earth right royally.
<BR>He locked the rivers, lakes, and all the rills--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    "I am no puny, maudlin king," quoth he,
<BR>"But a stern monarch, born to rule and reign;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And I will show my power to the end.
<BR>The Summer's flowery retinue I've slain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And taken the bold, free North-Wind for my friend.
<p>"Spring, Summer, Autumn--feeble queens they were,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    With their vast troops of flowers, birds, and bees,
<BR>Soft winds, that made the long green grasses stir--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    They lost their own identity in things like these!
<BR>I scorn them all! nay, I defy them all!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And none can wrest the sceptre from my hand.
<BR>The trusty North-Wind answers to my call,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And breathes his icy breath upon the land."
<p>The Siren, South-Wind, listening the while,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    Now floated airily across the lea.
<BR>"Oh, King!" she said, with tender tone and smile,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    "I come to do all homage unto thee.
<BR>In all the sunny region, whence I came,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    I find none like thee, King, so brave and grand!
<BR>Thine is a well-deserved, unrivalled fame;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    I kiss in awe, dear King, thy cold white hand."
<p>Her words were pleasing, and most fair her face.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    He listened rapt, to her soft-whispered praise.
<BR>She nestled nearer, in her Siren grace.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    "Dear King," she said, "henceforth my voice shall raise
<BR>But songs of thy unrivalled splendor! Lo!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    How white thy brow is! How thy garments shine!
<BR>I tremble 'neath thy beaming glance, for oh,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy wondrous beauty mak'st thee seem divine."
<p>The vain king listened, in a trance of bliss,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    To this most sweet sweet-voiced Siren from the South,
<BR>She nestled close, and pressed a lingering kiss
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    Upon the stern white pallor of his mouth.
<BR>She hung upon his breast, she pressed his cheek,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And he was nothing loth to hold her there,
<BR>While she such tender, loving words did speak,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And combed his white locks, with her fingers fair.
<p>And so she bound him, in her Siren wiles,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And stole his strength, with every glance she gave,
<BR>And stabbed him through and through with tender smiles,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And with her loving words she dug his grave;
<BR>And then she left him: old, and weak, and blind,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    And unlocked all the rivers, lakes and rills,
<BR>While the queen Spring, with her whole troop, behind,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of flowers, and birds, and bees, came over the hills.
<H3><A id="SUNSHINE">SUNSHINE  AND SHADOW.</A></H3>
<p>Life has its shadows, as well as its sun;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its lights and its shades, all twined together.
<BR>I tried to single them out, one by one,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Single and count them, determining whether
<BR>There was less blue than there was gray,
<BR>And more of the deep night than of the day.
<BR>But dear me, dear me, my task's but begun,
<BR>And I am not half way into the sun.
<p>For the longer I look on the bright side of earth,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The more of the beautiful do I discover;
<BR>And really, I never knew what life was worth
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I searched the wide storehouse of happiness over.
<BR>It is filled from the cellar well up to the skies,
<BR>With things meant to gladden the heart and the eyes.
<BR>The doors are unlocked, you can enter each room,
<BR>That lies like a beautiful garden in bloom.
<p>Yet life has its shadow, as well as its sun;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth has its storehouse of joy and of sorrow.
<BR>But the first is so wide-and my task's but begun
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the last must be left for a far distant morrow.
<BR>I will count up the blessings God gave in a row,
<BR>But dear me! when I get through them,
<BR>I know I shall have little time left for the rest,
<BR>For life is a swift-flowing river at best.

<BR>That each sorrow has its purpose--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;By the sorrowing oft unguessed,
<BR>But as sure as the Sun brings morning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever is--is best.
<p>I know that each sinful action,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As sure as the night brings shade,
<BR>Is sometime, somewhere punished,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' the hour be long delayed.
<BR>I know that the soul is aided
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes by the heart's unrest,
<BR>And to grow means often to suffer--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever is--is best.
<p>I know there are no errors,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great Eternal plan,
<BR>And all things work together
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the final good of man.
<BR>And I know when my soul speeds onward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In its grand Eternal quest,
<BR>I shall say, as I look back earthward,

<p>Where the grim old "Mount of Lamentation"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts up its summit like some great dome,
<BR>I list for the voices of Inspiration
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That rang o'er the meadows and hills of home.
<BR>I catch sweet sounds, but I am not near them,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are vast, vague oceans between us rolled;
<BR>Or it may be my heart is too full to hear them
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the eager ear that it lent of old.
<p>It is full of the joy of to-day--and to-morrow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which smiles with a promise of fresh delight;
<BR>And yet my honey is galled with sorrow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I think of the loved ones out of sight.
<BR>I wonder so soon if the dear old places
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are growing used to my absent feet,
<BR>I wonder if newer and fairer faces
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the hearts that housed me seem just as sweet.
<p>I know on the world's great field of battle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When a comrade falls out how the ranks close in;
<BR>The strife goes on with its rush and rattle,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And who can tell where he late has been?
<p>But through life a grafted vine I may wind me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;About old Eastern homes at length,
<BR>The roots of love that I left behind me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Western soil will keep their strength.
<BR>Though dear grows the "Mount of Lamentation."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And dear the ocean, and dear the shore,
<BR>I shall love the land of my Inspiration,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its lakes, its valleys, its tried hearts, more.

<p>If it were in my dead Past's power

<p>Re-pedestal from out the dust
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where long ago 'twas hurled,
<BR>My beautiful incautious trust
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this unworthy world.
<p>The symbol of my own soul's truth--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw it go with tears--
<BR>The sweet unwisdom of my youth--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That vanished with the years.
<p>Since knowledge brings us only grief,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would return again
<BR>To happy ignorance and belief
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In motives and in men.
<p>For worldly wisdom learned in pain

<p>A queen of indolence and idle grace,

<BR>Her throne is built upon a marshy down;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Malarial mosses wreathe her, like old lace.
<BR>With thin, crossed feet, unshod, and  bare and brown,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She sits indifferent to the world's swift race.
<p>Across the seas there stalks an ogre grim.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Too listless, she, for even Fear's alarms,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  While frightened nations rally in defense,

<p>Sometimes when I have dropped to sleep,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Draped in a soft luxurious gloom,
<BR>Across my drowsing mind will creep
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of another room,
<BR>Where resinous knots in roof boards made
<BR>A frescoing of light and shade,
<BR>And sighing poplars brushed their leaves
<BR>Against the humbly sloping eaves.
<p>Again I fancy, in my dreams,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm lying in my trundle bed;
<BR>I seem to see the bare old beams
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And unhewn rafters overhead;
<BR>The hornet's shrill falsetto hum
<BR>I hear again, and see him come
<BR>Forth from his dark-walled hanging house,
<BR>Dressed in his black and yellow blouse.
<p>There, summer dawns, in sleep I stirred,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And wove into my fair dream's woof
<BR>The chattering of a martin bird,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rain-drops pattering on the roof.
<BR>Or half awake, and half in fear,
<BR>I saw the spider spinning near
<BR>His pretty castle where the fly
<BR>Should come to ruin by-and-by.
<p>And there I fashioned from my brain
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth's shining structures in the air,
<BR>I did not wholly build in vain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For some were lasting, firm and fair.
<BR>And I am one who lives to say
<BR>My life has held more good than gray,
<BR>And that the splendor of the real
<BR>Surpassed my early dream's ideal.
<p>But still I love to wander back
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To that old time and that old place;
<BR>To tread my way o'er Memory's track,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch the early morning grace,
<BR>In that quaint room beneath the rafter,
<BR>That echoed to my childish laughter;
<BR>To dream again the dreams that grew
<BR>More beautiful as they came true.
<H3><A ID="COMRADE">MY COMRADE.</A></H3>
<p>Out from my window westward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn full oft my face;
<BR>But the mountains rebuke the vision
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That would encompass space;
<BR>They lift their lofty foreheads
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kiss of the clouds above,
<BR>And ask, "With all our glory,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we not win your love?"
<p>I answer, "No, oh mountains!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that you are grand;
<BR>But you have not the breadth and beauty
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fields in my own land;
<BR>You narrow my range of vision
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And you even shut from me
<BR>The voice of my old comrade,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Wind wild and free."
<p>But to-day I climbed the mountains
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the back of a snow-white steed,
<BR>And the West Wind came to greet me--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew on the wings of speed.
<BR>His charger, and mine that bore me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Went gaily neck to neck.
<BR>Till the town in the valley below us
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked like a small, dark speck.
<p>And oh! what tales he whispered
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As he rode there by me,
<BR>Of friends whose smiling faces
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so soon to see.
<BR>And the mountains frowned in anger,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I balked their spite,
<BR>And met my old-time comrade
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There on their very height;
<p>But I laughed up in their faces,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I rode slowly back,
<BR>While the Wind went faster and faster,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a race-horse on the track.

<BR>The days were tinged with glory,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The nights too quickly sped,
<BR>And life was like a story
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all the people wed.
<p>Before this rosebud wilted,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How passionately sweet
<BR>The wild waltz swelled and lilted
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In time for flying feet;

<p>Before this fan was broken,

<p>When this odd glove was mated,

<p>We will lay our summer away, my friend,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So tenderly lay it away.
<BR>It was bright and sweet to the very end,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one long, golden day.
<BR>Nothing sweeter could come to me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing sweeter to you.
<BR>We will lay it away, and let it be,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid from the whole world's view.
<p>We will lay it away like a dear, dead thing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead, yet forever fair;
<BR>And the fresh green robes of a deathless spring,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though dead, it shall always wear.
<BR>We will not hide it in grave or tomb,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But lay it away to sleep,
<BR>Guarded by beauty, and light, and bloom,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in a slumber deep.
<p>We were willing to let the summer go--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Willing to go our ways;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will either find such days.
<BR>You are my friend, and it may seem strange,

<p>If we should go back to the olden place,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the summer time went, too,
<BR>It would be like looking a ghost in the face,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So much would be changed and new.
<BR>We cannot live it over again,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even a single day;
<BR>And as something sweet, and free from pain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We had better lay it away.

<p>  I called to the summer sun,
<BR>"Come over the hills to-day!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlock the rivers, and tell them to run,
<BR>And kiss the snow-drifts and melt them away."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun came over--a tardy lover--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlocked the river, and told it to glide
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed the snow-drift till it fainted and died.
<p>  I called to the robin, "Come back!
<BR>Come up from the south and sing!"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And robin sailed up on an airy track,
<BR>And smoothed down his feathers and oiled his wing.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the notes came gushing, gurgling, rushing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In thrills and quavers, clear, mellow and strong,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the glad air quivered and rang with song.
<p>  I said to the orchard, "Blow!"
<BR>I said to the meadow, "Bloom!"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trees stood white, like brides in a row,
<BR>And the breeze was laden with rare perfume.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the meadows, in lights and shadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The daisies white and violets blue,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yellow-haired buttercups blossomed and grew.
<p>  I called to a hope, that died
<BR>With the death of the flowers and grass,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back! for the river is free to glide--
<BR>The robin sings, and the daisies bloom." Alas!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the hope I cherished too rudely perished
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To ever awaken and live again,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a hundred summers creep over the plain.

<p>Heigh ho! well, the season's over!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again we've come to Lent!
<BR>Programme's changed from balls and parties--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we're ordered to repent.
<BR>Forty days of self-denial!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell you what I think it pays--
<BR>Know't'l freshen my complexion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Going slow for forty days.
<p>No more savory Frenchy suppers--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as Madame R-- can give.
<BR>Well, I need a little<i>thinning</i>
<BR>Just a trifle--sure's you live!
<BR>Sometimes been afraid my plumpness
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Might grow into downright fat.
<BR>Rector urges need of fasting--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Think there's lot of truth in that.
<p>We must meditate, he tells us,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On our several acts of sin.
<BR>And repent them. Let me see now--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereabouts shall I begin!
<BR>Flirting--yes, they say 'tis wicked;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I'm awful penitent.
<BR>(Wonder if my handsome major
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes to early Mass through Lent?)
<p>Love of dress! I'm guilty there, too--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess it's my besetting sin.
<BR>Still I'm somewhat like the lilies,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For I neither toil nor spin.
<BR>Forty days I'!! wear my plainest--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Could repentance be more true?
<BR>What a saving on my dresses!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll make over just like new.
<p>Pride, and worldliness and all that,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rector bade us pray about
<BR>Every day through Lenten season,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I mean to be devout!
<BR>Papa always talks retrenchment--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lent is just the very thing.
<BR>Hope he'!! get enough in pocket
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So we'!! move up town next spring.
<H3><A id="VISION">MY VISION.</A></H3>
<p>Wherever my feet may wander
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever I chance to be,
<BR>There comes, with the coming of even' time
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A vision sweet to me.
<BR>I see my mother sitting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old familiar place,
<BR>And she rocks to the tune her needles sing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinks of an absent face.
<p>I can hear the roar of the city
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;About me now as I write;
<BR>But over an hundred miles of snow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My thought-steeds fly to-night,
<BR>To the dear little cozy cottage,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the room where mother sits,
<BR>And slowly rocks in her easy chair
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinks of me as she knits.
<p>Sometimes with the merry dancers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When my feet are keeping time,
<BR>And my heart beats high, as young hearts will,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the music's rhythmic chime.
<BR>My spirit slips over the distance
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the glitter and whirl,
<BR>To my mother who sits, and rocks, and knits,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinks of her "little girl."
<p>When I listen to voices that flatter,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And smile, as women do,
<BR>To whispered words that may be sweet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But are not always true;
<BR>I think of the sweet, quaint picture
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Afar in quiet ways,
<BR>And I know one smile of my mother's eyes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is better than all their praise.
<p>And I know I can never wander
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the path of right,
<BR>Though snares are set for a woman's feet
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In places that seem most bright.
<BR>For the vision is with me always,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever I chance to be,
<BR>Of mother sitting, rocking and knitting,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking and praying for me.
<H3><A id="DREAMTIME">DREAM-TIME.</A></H3>
<p>Throughout these mellow autumn days,
<BR>All sweet and dim, and soft with haze,
<BR>I argue with my unwise heart,
<BR>That fain would choose the idler's part.
<p>My heart says, "Let us lie and dream
<BR>Under the sunshine's softened beam,
<BR>This is the dream-time of the year,
<BR>When Heaven itself seems bending near.
<p>"See how the calm still waters lie
<BR>And dream beneath the arching sky.
<BR>The sun draws on a veil of haze,
<BR>And dreams away these golden days.
<p>"Put by the pen--lay thought aside,
<BR>And cease to battle with the tide.
<BR>Let us, like Nature, rest and dream
<BR>And float with the current of the stream."
<p>So pleads my heart. I answer "Nay,
<BR>Work waits for you and me to-day.
<BR>Behind these autumn hours of gold.
<BR>The winter lingers, bleak and cold.
<p>"And those who dream too long or much,
<BR>Must waken, shivering, at his touch,
<BR>With naught to show for vanished hours,
<BR>But dust of dreams and withered flowers.
<p>"So now, while days are soft and warm,
<BR>We must make ready for the storm."
<BR>Thus, through the golden, hazy weather,
<BR>My heart and I converse together.
<p>And yet, I dare not turn my eyes
<BR>To pebbly shores or tender skies,
<BR>Because I am so fain to do
<BR>E'en as my heart pleads with me to.

<p>Sing to me! something of sunlight and bloom,
<BR>I am so compassed with sorrow and gloom,
<BR>I am so sick with the world's noise and strife,--
<BR>Sing of the beauty and brightness of life--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sing to me, sing to me!
<p>Sing to me! something that's jubilant, glad!
<BR>I am so weary, my soul is so sad.
<BR>All my earth riches are covered with rust,
<BR>All my bright dreams are but ashes and dust.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sing to me, sing to me!
<p>Sing of the blossoms that open in spring,
<BR>How the sweet flowers blow, and the long lichens cling,
<BR>Say, though the winter is round about me,
<BR>There are bright summers and springs yet to be.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sing to me, sing to me!
<p>Sing me a song full of hope and of truth,
<BR>Brimming with all the sweet fancies of youth!
<BR>Say, though my sorrow I may not forget,
<BR>I have not quite done with happiness yet.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sing to me, sing to me!
<p>Lay your soft fingers just here, on my cheek;
<BR>Turn the light lower--there--no, do not speak,
<BR>But sing! My heart thrills at your beautiful voice;
<BR>Sing till I turn from my grief and rejoice.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sing to me, sing to me!

<p>The meadow lark's trill and the brown thrush's whistle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From morning to evening fill all the sweet air,
<BR>And my heart is as light as the down of a thistle--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is so bright and the earth is so fair.
<BR>There is life in the wood, there is bloom on the meadow;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The air drips with songs that the merry birds sing.
<BR>The sunshine has won, in the battle with shadow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's dressed the glad earth with robes of the spring.
<p>The bee leaves his hive for the field of red clover
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the vale where the daisies bloom white as the snow,
<BR>And a mantle of warm yellow sunshine hangs over
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm little pond, where the pale lilies grow.
<BR>In the woodland beyond it, a thousand gay voices
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are singing in chorus some jubilant air.
<BR>The bird and the bee, and all nature rejoices,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is so bright, and the earth is so fair.
<p>I am glad as a child, in this beautiful weather;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tossed all my burdens and trials away;
<BR>My heart is as light-yes, as light as a feather;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am care-free, and careless, and happy to-day.
<BR>Can it be there approaches a dark, drear to-morrow?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can shadows e'er fall on this beautiful earth!
<BR>Ah! to-day is my own! no forebodings of sorrow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall darken my skies, or shall dampen my mirth.
<H3><A ID="THOUGHT">A TWILIGHT THOUGHT.</A></H3>
<p>The sweet maid, Day, has pillowed her head
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the breast of her dusky lover. Night.
<BR>The sun has made her a couch of red,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And woven a cover of dim twilight;
<BR>And the lover kisses the maiden's brow,
<BR>As low on her couch, she sleepeth now.
<p>Here at my window, above the street,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit, as the day lies in repose;
<BR>And I list to the ceaseless tramp of feet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I watch this human tide that flows
<BR>Upward and downward, to and fro,
<BR>As the waves of an ocean, ebb and flow.
<p>Over and over the busy town;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither and thither, through all the day,
<BR>One goes up, and another down,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each in his own allotted way.
<BR>Strangers and kinsmen pass and meet,
<BR>And jar, and jostle upon the street.
<p>People that never met before,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;People that never will meet again;
<BR>A careless glance of the eye, no more,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And both are lost in the sea of men.
<BR>Strangers divided by miles, in heart,
<BR>Under my window meet and part.
<p>But whether their feet pass up, or down,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the river, east or west;
<BR>Whether it's in or out of the town,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To a haunt of sin, or a home of rest,--
<BR>We are journeying to a common goal--
<BR>There is one<i>last</i> point for every soul.
<p>Strangers and kinsmen, friend and foe,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether their aims are great or small,
<BR>Whether their paths lie high or low--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one last resting place for all.
<BR>Then upward, and onward, go surging by
<BR>Under my window--you all must die.
<H3><A id="BELLE">THE BELLE OF THE SEASON.</A></H3>
<p>Nay--do not bring the jewels--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Away with that robe of white,
<BR>I am sick of the ball room, sister--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would rather stay here, to-night.
<BR>"The grandest ball of the season!"
<BR >&nbsp;&nbsp;"The upper-ten thousands' show!"
<BR>Yes, yes, I know it, my darling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not care to go.
<p>Last night I was thinking deeply,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Something I seldom do.
<BR>You know I came home at midnight,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I lay awake till two.
<BR>I was thinking of my girlhood,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just how I had spent its years,
<BR>And I blushed for shame, my darling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And my pillow was wet with tears.
<p>I have lived in a whirl of fashion,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have kept right up to the "style,"
<BR>I have learned how to dance the "German,"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to bow, and flirt and smile.
<BR>I have worn most beautiful dresses,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Been the belle of many a ball.
<BR>I have won the envy of women,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the praise of fops-that's all
<p>Does any one really respect me?--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Could a single thing be said
<BR>That would give the mourners pleasure
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, if I were dead?
<BR>"She wore such beautiful dresses,"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's a dozen strings to her bow,"
<BR>"She could waltz like a perfect fairy"--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you like me remembered so?
<p>Well, there's nothing else to remember
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;What thing have I ever done
<BR>That has made a soul the better
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cheered a hapless one?
<BR>I have spent my time and money--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The best of my fortune and days--
<BR>In gaining the envy of women
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And making the poor fops gaze.
<p>I am going to be a woman,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And live for others awhile--
<BR>Forgetting myself for a season,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I know it isn't the "style."
<BR>I am in no mood for a revel--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Away with that robe of white!
<BR>And I will stay here, my darling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And talk with my heart to-night.
<H3><A id="JOY">JOY.</A></H3>
<p>My heart is like a little bird
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That sits and sings for very gladness.
<BR>Sorrow is some forgotten word,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, except in rhyme, is sadness.
<p>The world is very fair to me--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such azure skies, such golden weather,
<BR>I'm like a long caged bird set free,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is lighter than a feather.
<p>I rise rejoicing in my life;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I live with love for God and neighbor;
<BR>My days flow on unmarred by strife,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweetened by my pleasant labor.
<p>Oh youth! oh spring! oh happy days,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye are so passing sweet, and tender,
<BR>And while the fleeting season stays,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll revel care-free, in its splendor.
<H3><A id="BIRDHOPE1">BIRD OF HOPE.</A></H3>
<p>Soar not too high, oh bird of Hope!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the skies are fair;
<BR>The tempest may come on apace
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And overcome thee there.
<p>When far above the mountain tops
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou soarest, over all--
<BR>If, then, the storm should press thee back,
<BR> How great would be thy fall!
<p>And thou would'st lie here at my feet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor and lifeless thing,--
<BR>A torn and bleeding birdling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With a limp and broken wing.
<p>Sing not too loud, oh bird of Hope!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the day is bright;
<BR>The sunshine cannot always last--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The morn precedes the night.
<p>And if thy song is of the day,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when the day grows dim,
<BR>Forlorn and voiceless thou wouldst sit
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the shadows grim.
<p>Oh! I would have thee soar and sing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But not too high, or loud,
<BR>Remembering that day meets night
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliant sun the cloud.
<H3><A id="GOLDEN">A GOLDEN DAY.</A></H3>
<p>The subtle beauty of this day
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangs o'er me like a fairy spell,
<BR>And care and grief have flown away,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And every breeze sings, "All is well."
<BR>I ask, "Holds earth or sin, or woe?"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart replies, "I do not know."
<p>Nay! all we know, or feel, my heart,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is joy undimmed, complete;
<BR>In tears or pain we have no part;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of breathing is so sweet,
<BR>We care no higher joy to name.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;What reek we now of wealth or fame!
<p>The past--what matters it to me?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain it gave has passed away.
<BR>The future--that I cannot see!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I care for nothing save today--
<BR>This is a respite from all care,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And trouble flies--I know not where.
<p>Go on, oh, noisy, restless life!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass by, oh, feet that seek for heights!
<BR>I have no part in aught of strife;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want your vain delights.
<BR>The day wraps round me like a spell
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And every breeze sings, "All is well."

<p>All in the beautiful Autumn weather
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought lingers with me and stays;
<BR>Death and winter are coming together,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though both are veiled by the amber haze.
<BR>I look on the forest of royal splendor!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I look on the face in my quiet room;
<BR>A face all beautiful, sad and tender,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And both are stamped with the seal of doom.
<p>All through the days of Indian summer,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minute by minute and hour by hour.
<BR>I feel the approach of a dreaded Comer--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghastly presence of awful power.
<BR>I hear the birds in the early morning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they fly from the fields that are turning brown,
<BR>And at noon and at night my heart takes warning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maple leaves fall down and down.
<p>The sumac bushes are all a-flaming!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is scarlet, and gold, and green,
<BR>And my darling's beautiful cheeks are shaming
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The painted bloom of the ballroom queen.
<BR>Why talk of winter, amid such glory?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why speak of death of a thing so fair?
<BR>Oh, but the forest king white and hoary
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is weaving a mantle for both to wear.
<p>God! if I could by the soft deceiving
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of forests of splendor and cheeks of bloom
<BR>Lull my heart into sweet believing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for a moment and drown my gloom;
<BR>If I could forget for a second only
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And rest from the pain of this awful dread
<BR>Of days that are coming long and lonely
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Autumn goes and she is dead.
<p>But all the while the sun gilds wood and meadow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fair cheeks, hectic glows and cheats,
<BR>I know grim death sits veiled in shadow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaving for both their winding sheets.
<BR>I cannot help, and I cannot save her.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My hands are as weak as a babe's, new-born;
<BR>I must yield her up to One who gave her
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And wait for the resurrection morn.

<p class="centered">Dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. D. Atwood upon the celebration
<BR>of their silver wedding, August 25th, 1874.
<p>The harvest-moon of wedded love,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair in the heavens sailing,
<BR>Has reached mid-height, and, clear and bright,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives little sign of paling.
<p>Since first, above the horizon,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery crescent lifted,
<BR>The clouds of five-and-twenty years
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have o'er its surface drifted.
<p>But, while the days have come and gone,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though many a changing "morrow,"
<BR>The growing moon sailed up and on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the hills of sorrow.
<p>And, though with years came blinding tears,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The guiding moon grew brighter;
<BR>It gave relief, in time of grief--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Made heavy burdens lighter.
<p>One quarter of one hundred years
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been growing, filling,
<BR>Till, round and bright, its silvery light
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On all tonight is spilling.
<p>Oh, harvesters on life's great plain!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The young sheaves shining 'round you
<BR>Prove that you have not toiled in vain
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prove that God's blessing found you.
<p>Smile in the moonlight's silver gleam,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoice in harvest weather;
<BR>Ye know ye may not always keep
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The precious sheaves together!
<p>Shine on, oh moon of wedded bliss!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Live on through many a morrow,
<BR>Till from the sun of Immortal Love
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its golden light you borrow.

<p>Your words came just when needed. Like a breeze,
<BR>Blowing and bringing from the wide salt sea
<BR>Some cooling spray, to meadow scorched with heat
<BR>And choked with dust and clouds of sifted sand,
<BR>That hateful whirlwinds, envious of its bloom,
<BR>Had tossed upon it. But the cool sea breeze
<BR>Came laden with the odors of the sea
<BR>And damp with spray, that laid the dust and sand
<BR>And brought new life and strength to blade and bloom,
<BR>So words of thine came over miles to me,
<BR>Fresh from the mighty sea, a true friend's heart,
<BR>And brought me hope, and strength, and swept away
<BR>The dusty webs that human spiders spun
<BR>Across my path. Friend--and the word means much--
<BR>So few there are who reach like thee, a hand
<BR>Up over all the barking curs of spite
<BR>And give the clasp, when most its need is felt;
<BR>Friend, newly found, accept my full heart's thanks.

<p>She leaned out into the soft June weather,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With her long loose tresses the night breeze played;
<BR>Her eyes were as blue as the bells on the heather:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, what is so fair as a fair young maid!
<p>She folded her hands, like the leaves of a lily,
<BR>"My life," she said, "is a night in June,
<BR>Fair and quiet, and calm and stilly;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring me a change, oh changeful moon!
<p>"Who would drift on a lake forever?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Young hearts weary--it is not strange,
<BR>And sigh for the beautiful bounding river;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; New moon, true moon, bring me a change!"
<p>The rose that rivaled her maiden blushes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped from her breast, at a stranger's feet;
<BR>Only a glance; but the hot blood rushes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To mantle a fair face, shy and sweet.
<p>To and fro, while the moon is waning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They walk, and the stars shine on above;
<BR>And one is in earnest, and one is feigning
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, what is so sweet, as a sweet young love f
<p>A young life crushed, and a young heart broken,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A bleak wind blows through the lovely bower,
<BR>And all that remains of the love vows spoken--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the trampled leaf of a faded flower.
<p>The night is dark, for the moon is failing--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is so pale, as a pale old moon!
<BR>Cold is the wind through the tree tops wailing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe that the change should come so soon.

<p>They stood together at the garden gate;
<BR>They heard the night bird calling to his mate;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The sun had set,
<BR>And all the vines upon the summer bowers,
<BR>The long green grasses, and the blooming flowers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Were dewy wet.
<p>The sun's last rays had lit the Western skies
<BR>And dipped the mass of clouds in golden dyes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Brilliant and grand.
<BR>They stood in silence for a little while,
<BR>And then he turned, and with a tender smile
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  He took her hand.
<p>"Of all the sweet days we have known, my friend,"
<BR>He said half sadly, "This will be the end.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  I grieve to go,
<BR>Loving, as I shall never love again;
<BR>It rends my heart-strings, and it gives me pain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  But well I know
<p>"I could not make you happy with my love,
<BR>You, tender hearted, gentle as a dove,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And I--oh, well!
<BR>I cannot grovel on in this dull life.
<BR>How my soul yearns for scenes of noise and strife
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  No tongue can tell.
<p>"And so I give you back the pledge you gave,
<BR>I should but drag you to an early grave
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  With my unrest.
<BR>You are unfettered; but here at your feet
<BR>I leave my heart; oh, may you be, my sweet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forever blest."
<p>She drew from off her hand the hoop of gold
<BR>(Dearer to her by far than wealth untold)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And gave to him,
<BR>And as she, slow and silent, moved away,
<BR>Her life like all that Western sky grew gray
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And bleak and grim.
<p>He walks to-day, with kings upon the earth;
<BR>He dwells in scenes of revelry and mirth,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  With naught of care.
<BR>And she--the sun that set for her in deepest gloom,
<BR>And never rose, will rise beyond the tomb
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And meet her there.

<p>The strings of my heart were strung by Pleasure,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I laughed, when the music fell on my ear,
<BR>For he and Mirth played a joyful measure,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And they played so loud that I could not hear
<BR>The wailing and moaning of souls a-weary--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The strains of sorrow that floated around,
<BR>For my heart's notes rang loud and cheery,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I heard no other sound.
<p>Mirth and Pleasure, the music brothers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Played louder and louder in joyful glee;
<BR>But sometimes a discord was heard by others--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though only the rhythm was heard by me.
<BR>Louder and louder, and faster and faster
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands of the brothers played strain on strain,
<BR>When all of a sudden, a Mighty Master
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept them aside; and Pain,
<p>Pain, the musician, the soul-refiner,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrung the strings of my quivering heart,
<BR>And the air that he played was a plaintive minor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So sad that the tear-drops were forced to start;
<BR>Each note was an echo of awful anguish,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As shrill as solemn, as sharp as slow,
<BR>And my soul for a season seemed to languish
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And faint with its weight of woe.
<p>With skillful hands, that were never weary,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Master of Music played strain on strain,
<BR>And between the bars of the miserere,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew up the strings of my heart again,
<BR>And I was filled with a vague, strange wonder,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To see that they did not snap in two.
<BR>"They are drawn so tight they will break asunder,"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;    I thought, but instead, they grew.
<p>In the hands of the Master, firmer and stronger;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I could hear on the stilly air--
<BR>Now my ears were deafened by Mirth no longer--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds of sorrow, and grief, and despair;
<BR>And my soul grew tender and kind to others,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My nature grew sweeter, my mind grew broad,
<BR>And I held all men to be my brothers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linked by the chastening rod.
<p>My soul was lifted to God and heaven,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And when on my heart-strings fell again
<BR>The hands of Mirth and Pleasure, even,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a discord to mar the strain,
<BR>For Pain, the musician, and soul-refiner,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Attuned the strings with a master hand,
<BR>And whether the music be major or minor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always sweet and grand.
<H3><A id="DOOMED">THE DOOMED CITY'S PRAYER.</A></H3>
<p>I heard a low sound, like a troubled soul praying:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the winds of the winter night brought it to me.
<BR>'Twas the doomed city's voice: "Oh, kind snow," it was saying,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, cover my ruins, so ghastly to see.
<BR>I am robbed of my beauty, and shorn of my glory;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strength that I boasted--where is it to-day?
<BR>I am down in the dust; and my pitiful story
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes tearless eyes weep, and unpious lips pray.
<p>"I--I, who have reveled in pomp and in power,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Am down on my knees, with my face in the dust;
<BR>But yesterday queen, with a queen's royal dower,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day I am glad of a crumb or a crust.
<BR>But yesterday reigning, a grand mighty city,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride of the nation, the queen of the West;
<BR>To-day I am gazed at, an object of pity,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A charity child, asking alms, at the best.
<p>"My strength, and my pride, and my glory departed,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My fair features scorched by the fire fiend's breath,
<BR>Is it strange that I'm soul-sick and sorrowful hearted?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it strange that my thoughts run on ruin and death?
<BR>Oh, white, fleecy clouds that are drooping above me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark, hark to my pleadings, and answer my sighs,
<BR>And let down the beautiful snow, if you love me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover my wounds from all pitying eyes.
<p>"I am hurled from my throne, but not hurled down forever;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall rise from the dust; I shall live down my woes--
<BR>But my heart lies to-day, like a dumb, frozen river;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When to thaw out and flow again, God only knows.
<BR>Oh, sprites of the air! I beseech you to weave me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A mantle of white snow, and beautiful rime
<BR>To cover my unsightly ruins; then leave me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of the healer of all wounds--'Old Time.'"

<p>In the warm yellow smile of the morning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She stands at the lattice pane,
<BR>And watches the strong young binders
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stride down to the fields of grain,
<BR>And she counts the over and over
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they pass the cottage door:
<BR>Are they six? she counts them seven--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they seven? she counts one more.
<p>When the sun swings high in the heavens,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reapers go shouting home,
<BR>She calls to the household, saying
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make haste! for the binders have come!
<BR>And Johnnie will want his dinner--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He was always a hungry child;"
<BR>And they answer, "Yes, it is waiting;"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then tell you, "Her brain is wild."
<p>Again, in the hush of the evening,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the work of the day is done,
<BR>And the binders go singing homeward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last red rays of the sun,
<BR>She will sit at the threshold waiting,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And her withered face lights with joy:
<BR>"Come, Johnnie," she says, as they pass her,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come into the house, my boy."
<p>Five summers ago, her Johnnie
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Went out in the smile of the morn,
<BR>Singing across the meadow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Striding down through the corn--
<BR>He towered above the binders,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on either side,
<BR>And the mother's heart within her
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelled with exultant pride.
<p>For he was the light of the household--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;His brown eyes were wells of truth,
<BR>And his face was the face of the morning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit with its pure, fresh youth,
<BR>And his song rang out from the hill-tops
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the mellow blast of a horn,
<BR>As he strode o'er the fresh shorn meadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And down through the rows of corn.
<p>But hushed were the voices of singing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushed by the presence of death,
<BR>As back to the cottage they bore him--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the noontide's scorching breath,
<BR>For the heat of the sun had slain him,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Had smitten the heart in his breast,
<BR>And he who had towered above them
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay lower than all the rest.
<p>The grain grows ripe in the sunshine,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the summers ebb and flow,
<BR>And the binders stride to their labor
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing as they come and go;
<BR>But never again from the hill-tops
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoes the voice like a horn;
<BR>Never up from the meadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Never back from the corn.
<p>Yet the poor, crazed brain of the mother
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancies him always near;
<BR>She is blest in her strange delusion,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For she knoweth no pain nor fear,
<BR>And always she counts the binders
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they pass her cottage door;
<BR>Are they six, she counts them seven:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they seven, she counts one more.

<p>Nine o'clock, and the sun shines as yellow and warm,
<BR>As though 'twere a fete day. I wish it would storm:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wish the thunder would crash,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the red lightning flash,
<BR>And lap the black clouds, with its serpentine tongue.
<BR>The day is too calm, for a man to be hung.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hung! ugh, what a word!
<BR>The most heartless and horrible ear ever heard.
<p>He has murdered, and plundered, and robbed, so "they say";
<BR>Been the scourge of the country, for many a day.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  He was lawless and wild;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Man, woman, or child
<BR>Met no mercy, no pity, if found in his path;
<BR>He was worse than a beast of the woods, in his wrath.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And yet--to be hung,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh, my God! to be swung
<BR>By the neck to, and fro, for the rabble to see--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The thought sickens me.
<p>Thirty minutes past nine. How the time hurries by,
<BR>But a half hour remains, at ten he will die.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Die? No! he'll be killed!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  For God never willed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Men should die in this way.
<BR>"Vengeance is mine," He saith, "I will repay."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yet what could be done
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  With this wild, lawless one!
<BR>No prison could hold him, and so--he must swing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's a horrible thing!
<p>Outcast, Desperado, Fiend, Knave; all of these
<BR>And more. But call him whatever you please,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  I cannot forget
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  He's a mortal man yet:
<BR>That he once was a babe, and was hushed into rest,
<BR>And fondled and pressed, to a woman's warm breast.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was sung to, and rocked,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And when he first walked
<BR>With his weak little feet, he was petted, and told
<BR>He was "mamma's own pet, worth his whole weight in gold."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And this is the end
<BR>Of a God-given life. Just think of it, friend!
<p>Hark! hear you that chime? 'Tis the clock striking ten.
<BR>The dread weight falls down, with a sound like "Amen."
<BR>Does murder pay murder? do two wrongs make a right?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh, that horrible sight!
<BR>I am shut in my room, and have covered my face,
<BR>But the dread scene has followed me into this place.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  I see that strange thing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like a clock pendulum swing
<BR>To and fro, in the air, back and forth, to and fro.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  One moment ago
<BR>'Twas a man, in God's image! now hide it, kind grave.
<BR>What a terrible end, to the life that God gave.
<H3><A id="DEAD">WHEN I AM DEAD.</A></H3>
<p>When I am dead, if some chastened one,
<BR> Seeing the "item," or hearing it said
<BR>That my play is over and my part done,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I lie asleep in my narrow bed--
<BR>If I could know that some soul would say,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking aloud or silently,
<BR>"In the heat and the burden of the day,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a refreshing draught to me;"
<p>Or, "When I was lying nigh unto death
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She nursed me to life and to strength again,
<BR>And when I labored and struggled for breath
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She smoothed and quieted down my pain;"
<BR>Or, "When I was groping in grief and doubt,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, and turned from the light o' the day,
<BR>Her hand reached me and helped me out
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And led me up to the better way;"
<p>Or, "When I was hated and shunned by all,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowing under my sin and my shame,
<BR>She, once in passing me by, let fall
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Words of pity and hope, that came
<BR>Into my heart like a blessed calm
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the waves of the stormy sea,
<BR>Words of comfort, like oil and balm,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She spake, and the desert blossomed for me;"
<p>Better, by far, than a marble tomb--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a monument towering over my head
<BR>(What shall I care, in my quiet room,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For headboard or footboard when I am dead?);
<BR>Better than glory, or honors, or fame
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Though I am striving for those to-day),
<BR>To know that some heart would cherish my name
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And think of me kindly, with blessings, alway.

<p>Across the sodden field we gaze,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To woodlands, painted gold and brown;
<BR>To hills that hide in purple haze,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And proudly wear the Autumn's crown.
<BR>Oh, lavish Autumn! fair, we know,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet we cannot deem her so.
<p>The blossoms had their little day;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The grasses, and the green-hung trees.
<BR>They lived, grew old, and passed away.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, not satisfied with these,
<BR>The cruel Autumn could not pass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this last fell stroke. Alas!
<p>"Alas," we cry, because God's ways
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem so at variance with our own,
<BR>And grieving through the nights and days,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We see not that His love was shown
<BR>In gathering to His "Harvest Home"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lost one, from the grief to come.
<p>Oh, tears! she will not have to weep!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Woes! she will not have to bear!
<BR>For her, who fell so soon asleep,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No furrowed face, no whitened hair.
<BR>And yet we would have given her these,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu of heavenly victories.
<p>How weak the strongest mortal love!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How selfish in its tenderness!
<BR>How God's angelic host above
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Must wonder at our blind distress!
<BR>We see her still grave, dark and dim,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And they see only Heaven and Him.
<p>Perpetual youth! oh, priceless boon!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever youthful: never old!
<BR>How can we think she died too soon?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;What though life's story was half told?
<BR>Wiser than all earth's seers, to-day,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this fair soul, that passed away.
<p>Magician, sage, philosopher,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With all their vast brain-wealth combined,
<BR>Are only babes, compared with her:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;This soul, that left the "things behind"
<BR>And, "reaching to the things before,"

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With sorrow in its cadence,
<BR>Not thinking how thy sainted brow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Glows with a Christly radiance.
<p>Do spirits hover in the air?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the dear dead ones never

<p>    There's the ghost of a Hope
<BR>That lighted my days with a fanciful glow;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In her hand is the rope
<BR>That strangled her life out. Hope was slain long ago.
<p>    But her ghost comes to-night,
<BR>With its skeleton face, and expressionless eyes,

<BR>And mocks me, and jeers me with sobs and with sighs.
<p>    There's the ghost of a Joy,
<BR>A frail, fragile thing, and I prized it too much,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the hands that destroy
<BR>Clasped it close, and it died at the withering touch.
<p>    There's the ghost of a love,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;  But he towers above

<BR>And thinking of all that I might have been
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had but lived without them.
<BR>So many times have I laid my plan,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to spoil it in doing;
<BR>And much of the work that the world calls good
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has left me cause for rueing.
<p>Each thing that I do is like the page
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a hurriedly written letter;--
<BR>Full of good thoughts perhaps, but the blots
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prove that it might be better.
<BR>I have wished for the world's applause, and thought
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it praise and wonder,
<BR>But my noblest aim and best laid plan
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sure to be spoiled by a blunder.
<p>I think I have lived too far from God,--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I ever doubt Him,
<BR>But feeling too sure of my strength, I've tried
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To do some things without Him.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is painting the West all red.
<BR>All threaded with gold and crimson,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And burnished with amber dye,
<BR>And tipped with purple shadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory flameth high.
<p>Fair, beautiful world of ours!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair, beautiful world, but oh,
<BR>How darkened by pain and sorrow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How blackened by sin and woe.
<BR>The splendor pales in the heavens
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And dies in a golden gleam,
<BR>And alone in the hush of twilight,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit, in a checkered dream.
<p>I think of the souls that are straying,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In shadows as black as night,
<BR>Of hands that are groping blindly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of the shining light;
<BR>Of hearts that are mutely crying,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And praying for just one ray,
<BR>To lead them out of the shadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the better way.
<p>I think of the Father's children
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are trying to walk alone,
<BR>Who have dropped the hand of the Parent,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And wander in ways unknown.
<BR>Oh, the paths are rough and thorny,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know they cannot stand.
<BR>They will faint and fall by the wayside,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unguided by God's right hand.
<p>And I think of the souls that are yearning
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow the good and true;
<BR>That are striving to live unsullied,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet know not what to do.
<BR>And I wonder when God, the Master,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall end this weary strife,
<BR>And lead us out of the shadows
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the deathless life.

<p>Whoever you are as you read this,

<H3><A id="SPIRIT">SONG OF THE SPIRIT.</A></H3>
<p>Too sweet and too subtle for pen or for tongue
<BR>In phrases unwritten and measures unsung,
<BR>As deep and as strange as the sounds of the sea,
<BR>Is the song that my spirit is singing to me.
<p>In the midnight and tempest when forest trees shiver,
<BR>In the roar of the surf, and the rush of the river,
<BR>In the rustle of leaves and the fall of the rain,
<BR>And on the low breezes I catch the refrain.
<p>From the vapors that frame and envelope the earth,
<BR>And beyond, from the realms where my spirit had birth,
<BR>From the mists of the land and the fogs of the sea,
<BR>Forever and ever the song comes to me.
<p>I know not its wording--its import I know--
<BR>For the rhythm is broken, the measure runs low,
<BR>When vexed or allured by the things of this life
<BR>My soul is merged into its pleasures or strife.
<p>When up to the hill tops of beauty and light
<BR>My soul like a lark in the ether takes flight,
<BR>And the white gates of heaven shine brighter and nearer,
<BR>The song of the spirit grows sweeter and clearer.
<p>Up, up to the realms where no mortal has trod--
<BR>Into space and infinity near to my God--
<BR>With whiteness, and silence, and beautiful things,
<BR>I am borne when the voice of eternity sings.
<p>When once in the winds or the drop of the rain
<BR>Thy spirit shall listen and hear the refrain,
<BR>Thy soul shall soar up like a bird on the breeze,
<BR>And the things that have pleased thee will never more please.
<H3><A id="PILGRIM">THE PILGRIM FATHERS.</A></H3>
<p>And now when poets are singing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Their song of olden days,
<BR>And now, when the land is ringing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With sweet Centennial lays,
<BR>My muse goes wandering backward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the groundwork of all these,
<BR>To the time when our Pilgrim Fathers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Came over the winter seas.
<p>The sons of a mighty kingdom,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a cultured folk were they,
<BR>Born amidst pomp and splendor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bred in it, day by day.
<BR>Children of bloom and beauty,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reared under skies serene,
<BR>Where the daisy and hawthorne blossomed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ivy was always green.
<p>And yet, for the sake of freedom,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For a free religious faith,
<BR>They turned from home and people,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood face to face with death.
<BR>They turned from a tyrant ruler
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood on the new world's shore,
<BR>With a waste of waters behind them,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And a waste of land before.
<p>Oh, men of a great Republic;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a land of untold worth;
<BR>Of a nation that has no equal
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon God's round green earth;
<BR>I hear you sighing and crying
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the hard, close times at hand;
<BR>What think you of those old heroes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rock 'twixt sea and land.
<p>The bells of a million churches
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ringing out to-night,
<BR>And the glitter of palace windows
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills all the land with light;
<BR>And there is the home and college,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is the feast and ball,
<BR>And the angels of peace and freedom
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are hovering over all.
<p>They had no church, no college,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No banks, no mining stock;
<BR>They had but the waste before them,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea and Plymouth Rock.
<BR>But there in the night and tempest,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With gloom on every hand,
<BR>They laid the first foundation
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a nation great and grand.
<p>There were no weak repinings,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No shrinking from what might he,
<BR>But with their brows to the tempest,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And with their backs to the sea,
<BR>They planned out a noble future,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And planted the corner-stone
<BR>Of the grandest, greatest republic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has ever known.
<p>Oh, women in homes of splendor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh lily-buds frail and fair,
<BR>With fortunes upon your fingers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And milk-white pearls in your hair,
<BR>I hear you longing and sighing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For some new fresh delight;
<BR>But what of those Pilgrim mothers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On that December night?
<p>I hear you talking of hardships,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear you moaning of loss,
<BR>Each has her fancied sorrow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bears her self-made cross.
<BR>But they, they had only their husbands,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain, the rock, and the sea;
<BR>Yet, they looked up to God and blessed Him,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And were glad because they were free.
<p>Oh, grand old Pilgrim heroes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, souls that were tried and true,
<BR>With all of our proud possessions
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are humbled at thought of you.
<BR>Men of such might and muscle,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Women so brave and strong,
<BR>Whose faith was fixed as the mountains,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a night so dark and long.
<p>We know of your grim, grave errors,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As husbands and as wives;
<BR>Of the rigid bleak ideas
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That starved your daily lives;
<BR>Of pent-up, curbed emotions,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of feelings crushed, suppressed,
<BR>That God with the heart created
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In every human breast.
<p>We know of the little remnant
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of British tyranny,
<BR>When you hunted Quakers and witches,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And swung them from a tree;
<BR>Yet back to a holy motive,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To live in the fear of God,
<BR>To a purpose light, exalted,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To walk where martyrs trod.
<p>We can trace your gravest errors.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your aim was fixed and sure;
<BR>And e'en if your acts were fanatic,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We know your hearts were pure.
<BR>You lived so near to heaven,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;You overreached your trust,
<BR>And deemed yourselves creators,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting you were but dust
<p>But we with our broader visions,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With our wider realms of thought,
<BR>I often think would be better
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we lived as our fathers taught.
<BR>Their lives seemed bleak and rigid,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Narrow and void of bloom;
<BR>Our minds have too much freedom,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And conscience too much room.
<p>They overreached in duty,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They starved their hearts for the right;
<BR>We live too much in the senses,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We bask too long in the light.
<BR>They proved by their clinging to Him
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of God in man;
<BR>And we, by our love of license,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen a Darwin's plan.
<p>But bigotry reached its limit,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And license must have its sway,
<BR>And both shall result in profit
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To those of a later day.
<BR>With the fetters of slavery broken,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And freedom's flag unfurled,
<BR>Our nation strides onward and upward,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And stands the peer of the world.
<p>Spires and domes and steeples
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Glitter from shore to shore;
<BR>The waters are white with commerce,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is studded with ore;
<BR>Peace is sitting above us,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And Plenty, with laden hand,
<BR>Wedded to sturdy Labor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes singing through the land.
<p>Then let each child of the nation
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who glories in being free,
<BR>Remember the Pilgrim Fathers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stood on the rock by the sea;
<BR>For there in the rain and tempest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a night long passed away,
<BR>They sowed the seeds of a harvest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We gather in sheaves to-day.
<H3><A id="BUELL">LINES WRITTEN UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES BUELL.</A></H3>
<p>Something is missing from the balmy spring;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no perfume in its gentle breath;
<BR>And there are sobs in songs the wild birds sing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the bees chant of the grave and death--
<BR>Something is missing from the earth. One morn
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The angels called a new name on the roll;
<BR>A spirit soldier to their ranks was borne,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And all Christ's army welcomed the pure young soul.
<p>He died. Two little words, but only God
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Can understand the awful depths of woe
<BR>They hold for those who pass beneath the rod,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Praying for strength, from Him who aimed the blow.
<BR>He died. The soldier who fought long and well,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who walked with Death upon the battle-field,
<BR>Among the bellowing guns--the shrieking shell--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In poison prison dens--and would not yield.
<p>A six month three times told, he languished there,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet he lived; oh, young heart, strong and brave!
<BR>Thank God, who heard the oft repeated prayer;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank God, he does not fill a Southern grave;
<BR>That when he died, the loved ones gathered round,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And eased the anguish of those last, sad hours;
<BR>That gentle hands can keep the precious mound
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; All green with mosses, and abloom with flowers.
<p>He was so young and fair; and life was sweet.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ give the mourners strength to drain the cup.
<BR>He went to make the Heavenly ranks complete.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; God sent the angel Death, to bear him up
<BR>So young, and fair and brave; so loved by all;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The lisping child-life's veteran, bent and gray--
<BR>The eyes grew dim, and bitter tear-drops fall
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the mound where lies the soldier's clay.
<p>Oh! it is sweet to feel that God knows best,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who called in youth this brother, friend and son,
<BR>And sweet to lean upon the Saviour's breast,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And looking upward, say, "Thy will be done."
<BR>But something is missing from the balmy spring;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no perfume in its gentle breath,
<BR>And there are sobs in songs the wild birds sing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the bees chant of the grave, and death.

<p>  These quiet autumn days,
<BR>My soul, like Noah's dove, on airy wings
<BR>Goes out, and searches for the hidden things
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the hills of haze.
<p>  With mournful, pleading cries,
<BR>Above the waters of the voiceless sea
<BR>That laps the shores of Eternity,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day it flies.
<p>  Searching, but all in vain,
<BR>For some stray leaf that it may light upon
<BR>And read the future as the days agone--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its pleasure and its pain.
<p>  Listening, patiently,
<BR>For some voice speaking from the mighty deep,
<BR>Revealing all the secrets it doth keep
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, there for me.
<p>  Come back and wait, my soul!
<BR>Day after day thy search has been in vain.
<BR>Voiceless and silent o'er the future's pain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mystic waters roll.
<p>  God seeing, knoweth best,
<BR>And day by day the waters shall subside,
<BR>And thou shalt know what lies beneath the tide;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then wait, my soul, and rest.

<p>She sits beside the window. All who pass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn once again to gaze on her sweet face.
<BR>She is so fair; but soon, too soon, alas,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To lie down in her last low resting place.
<p>No gems are brighter than her sparkling eyes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brow like polished marble, white and fair--
<BR>Her cheeks as glowing as the sunset skies--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;You would not dream that death was lurking there.
<p>But, oh! he lingers closely at her side,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the forest dons her Autumn dress,
<BR>We know that he will claim her as his bride,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And earth will number one fair spirit less.
<p>She sees the meadow robed in richest green--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughing stream--the willows bending o'er.
<BR>With tear dimmed eyes she views each sylvan scene,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinks earth never was so fair before.
<p>We do not sigh for Heaven, till we have known,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Something of sorrow, something of grief and woe,
<BR>And as a summer day her life has flown.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, can we wonder she is loath to go?
<p>She has no friends in Heaven: all are here.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No lost one waits her in that unknown land,
<BR>And life grows doubly, trebly sweet and dear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As day by day, she nears the mystic strand.
<p>We love her and we grieve to see her go.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is Christ who calls her to His breast,
<BR>And He shall greet her, and she soon shall know
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The joys of souls that dwell among the blest.
<H3><A id="ADREAM">A DREAM.</A></H3>
<p>The shadows of a winter night were falling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The snows were drifting in my cottage door--
<BR>And loud the voices of the winds were calling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When there came a stranger, lone, despised, and poor!
<p>Came to my glowing hearth, all humbly pleading
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For food and shelter till the day should dawn--
<BR>But to his every word I stood unheeding,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned him forth and bade him wander on.
<p>I have six little ones to guard from danger;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a pillow for each precious head;
<BR>But nought to waste upon a beggared stranger--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And "charity begins at home," I said.
<p>All fierce and loud the winter wind was groaning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some lost spirit, doomed to death it seemed;
<BR>While at some door it made its ceaseless moaning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought my pillow, and I slept and dreamed.
<p>I dreamed I stood at Heaven's gate entreating,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping and wailing for the other side;
<BR>While in the gloom I stood, all wildly beating,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Begging the angel guard to open wide.
<p>At length I heard the pearly hinges turning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the glories that no tongue can tell.
<BR>Before me all the hues of Heaven burning,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind me all the gloom of death and hell.
<p>I strove to enter, but a voice like thunder,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried "Come no nearer, oh! thou soul of sin."
<BR>And I shrank down in awful fear and wonder,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For I had thought to enter boldly in.
<p>Again the voice cried, "When in woe and anguish,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought a shelter at thy glowing hearth,
<BR>Thou turned me out, unclothed, unfed to languish,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And wander wearily upon the earth.
<p>"Depart from here, thou selfish sinful mortal,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On heaven's perfect face, a stain and blot;
<BR>For never can'st thou cross the shining portal,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye knew not me and now I know ye not."
<H3><A id="IDLE">IDLER'S SONG.</A></H3>
<p>I sit in the twilight dim,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the close of an idle day,
<BR>And list to the sweet, soft hymn
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises far away
<BR>And dies on the evening air.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, all day long,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They sing their song,
<BR>Who toil in the valley there.
<p>But never a song sing I,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting with folded hands,
<BR>The hours pass me by--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping their golden sands--
<BR>And I list from day to day,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the "tick, tick, tock,"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old brown clock,
<BR>Ticking my life away.
<p>And I see the twilight fade,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I see the night come on,
<BR>And then, in the gloom and shade,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I weep for the day that's gone--
<BR>Weep and wail in pain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the misspent day
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That has flown away,
<BR>And will not come again.
<p>Another morning beams,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I forget the last,
<BR>And sit in my idle dreams
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the day is over--past.
<BR>Oh, the toiler's heart is glad!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day is gone
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the night comes on,
<BR>But mine is sore and sad.
<p>For I dare not look behind!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No shining, golden sheaves
<BR>Can I ever hope to find:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but withered leaves.
<BR>Ah! dreams are very sweet!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But will it please
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If only these
<BR>I lay at the Master's feet.
<p>And what will the Master say,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To dreams and nothing more?
<BR>Oh, idler all the day!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, ere thy life is o'er!
<BR>And when the day grows late,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, soul of sin,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will He let you in
<BR>There at the pearly gate?
<p>Oh, idle heart beware!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On, to the field of strife!
<BR>On, to the valley there,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And live a useful life.
<BR>Up! do not wait a day!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the old brown clock,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With its "tick, tick, tock,"

<p>I know a "righteous Christian,"

<BR>He goes to church on Sunday
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinks his duty done.
<BR>And always at prayer-meeting,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighs, and groans, and prays;
<BR>And talks about the sinners,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And warns them from their ways.
<p>And many of his neighbors,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows are bound for hell;
<BR>Although they love their Master,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And do their duty well.
<BR>But they pray within their closet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not own a "pew,"
<BR>And he's sure they'll not be numbered
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among God's chosen few.
<p>He exhorts men to be careful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep from worldly strife.
<BR>And he thinks a race for riches
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing in this life.
<BR>"Do good," he cried, "with money,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who have aught to spare,"
<BR>And he preaches quite a sermon,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And ends it with a prayer.
<p>Well! he has bonds with coupons,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And lots of cash on hand,
<BR>And when the fierce Fire Demon,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Went raging through our land,
<BR>The neighborhood was canvassed,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For money, clothes, and food,
<BR>To send the starving people,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man who cries, "Do good,"--
<p>My preaching, praying Christian,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now boasts, in pride and glee,
<BR>"Those begging, sponging rascals,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn't get a cent from me!
<BR>I don't believe their stories,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;About the suffering poor,
<BR>The thieves were after money,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I sent them from my door."
<p>Oh, out upon such a pretense!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;May a curse be upon his gold,
<BR>And the cries of an hundred people,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry, and naked, and cold,
<BR>Ring in his ears forever;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the words his false lips pray
<BR>Fall on deaf ears in heaven,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From now till the Judgment Day.
<p>Oh "hypocrites, and liars!"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your prayers blaspheme God's name!
<BR>And if the angels hear them,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They blush for you in shame,

<p>The great high arch of heaven, like tapestry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On ancient walls, was grandly colored--save
<BR>The quiet, cloudless west, that was a sea
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of purest crystal--golden wave on wave.
<BR>"Oh love," she whispered, "open wide the blind,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me see the glory of the West;
<BR>There just across the sea, my soul will find--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;What here is never found--find peace and rest."
<p>Deeper, and darklier grand, the bright clouds grew,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And red and amber streaks shot through the North.
<BR>The very light of heaven was shining through
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal West. She reached her thin hand forth
<BR>And a strange splendor fell upon her face;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And her dark eyes glowed with unearthly light.
<BR>I knew it came from God's celestial plane,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is neither sorrow, death, nor night.
<p>"Oh love!" she cried, "my struggling spirit yearns
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave this clay and go across the sea,
<BR>Look! how to molten gold the whole sky turns;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And see that white hand beckoning to me.
<BR>Oh love, my love, this is not death, to go
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;At this sweet hour across the golden tide;
<BR>To drop my every care, and henceforth know
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the pleasures of that other side."
<p>The angel took the tapestries away,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And rolled them up in heaven, out of sight,
<BR>Leaving the common walls of sombre gray
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the dews and damp fogs of the night.
<BR>The west wind played upon his dulcimer.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I leaned across her couch with bated breath;

<BR>Such men have not all passed away.
<p>Bless God, enough are left, at least
<BR>To put a muzzle on the beast
<BR>That walks our land from breadth to length
<BR>And robs the strong man of his strength,
<BR>Takes bread from babes, steals wise men's brains,
<BR>And leaves them bound in helpless chains;
<BR>Makes sin and sorrow, shame and woe,
<BR>Where e'er his cloven foot may go.
<BR>This is the mission of the beast
<BR>Whose bloated keepers sit and feast
<BR>On seasoned dainties that were bought
<BR>With blood, and tears, and God knows what.
<BR>Keepers who laugh when women cry,
<BR>Who smile when children starve and die,
<BR>If so they gain one farthing more
<BR>To add to their ill-gotten store.
<p>From south and north and west and east,
<BR>The people clamored: "Chain the beast!
<BR>Fetter the monster Alcohol,
<BR>Before he robs us of our all."
<p>Thank God, the earnest cry was heard,
<BR>And hearts of noble men were stirred,
<BR>And though a weak-kneed host went down
<BR>Before the keeper's threatening frown,
<BR>Enough were left--a bold, brave few,
<BR>Strong-brained, broad-souled men that were true,
<BR>Men who were men, and did not fear
<BR>The villain's threat, the coward's sneer;
<BR>Enough to muzzle with the law
<BR>The foulest beast the world e'er saw.
<BR>Thank God, thank God, the people say.
<BR>True men have not all passed away.

<p>Upon a couch all robed by careful hands
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For her repose, the maiden Mable lies
<BR>Her long bright hair is braided in smooth bands--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A mass of stranded gold, that mortal eyes
<p>May, wondering, gaze upon a little while;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That mortal hands may touch a few times more.
<BR>Her placid lips part in a sweet, faint smile;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the glories of that mystic shore
<p>When first they fell upon her spirit eyes--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All the rare splendors of that unseen way--
<BR>Had touched her with a wondering, glad surprise,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And left the pleased expression on her clay.
<p>Her two fair hands are crossed upon her breast--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two shapes of wax upon a drift of snow.
<BR>And they have robed her for her peaceful rest.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in the hateful shroud--that sign of woe,
<p>But in that garb we loved to see her wear;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark blue robe, fashioned by her own hand.
<BR>I wonder, as I see her lying there,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If God will give her spirit in His land
<p>Another shape. She could not be more fair.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he will not change her form, or face,
<BR>But with the same long, rippling, golden hair
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; She will kneel down before the throne of grace,
<p>And wipe God's feet; and her dark eyes will raise
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to Christ's face, and touch Him with her hand,
<BR>And will with her own sweet voice, sing God's praise
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And still be fairest in the Angel band.

<p>Over the ocean of life's commotion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sail till the night comes on.
<BR>Sail and sail in a tiny boat,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting wherever the billows go.
<BR>Out on the treacherous sea afloat,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat by the cruel winds that blow,
<BR>Hither and thither our boat is drawn,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the day dies out and the night comes on.
<p>Over a meadow of light and shadow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wander with weary feet,
<BR>Seeking a bauble men call "Fame,"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasping the dead-sea fruit named "wealth,"
<BR>Finding each but an empty name,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the night--the night steals on by stealth.
<BR>And we count the season of slumber sweet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When hope lies dead in the arms of defeat.
<p>Over the river a great Forever,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretches beyond our sight.
<BR>But I know by the glistening pearly gates
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Afar from the region of strife and sin,
<BR>A beautiful angel always waits
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome the sheep of the shepherd in.
<BR>And out of the shadows of gloom and night,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They enter the mansion of peace and light.

<p>My heart that otherwise was glad
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(So much God gives to make it so)
<BR>This golden afternoon is sad
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And troubled with another's woe;
<BR>And stranger that I am, I fain
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would send some solace for her pain.
<p>My talks with Sorrow have been brief;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She touched my robe, in gliding by--
<BR>And when I've chanced to meet with Grief,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He's passed me with averted eye.
<BR>Yet, through another's pain, I see
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a glimpse of what may be.
<p>And of all griefs that mortals know--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that pierce the human heart,
<BR>There seems to me no other woe
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that which rends the soul apart,
<BR>When a fond mother sees death's night
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealing an infant's eyes of light.
<p>The babe endeared by pangs and fears
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That she has suffered for its sake,
<BR>The babe she watched above with tears,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sat through lonely nights, awake.
<BR>And sang some tender lullaby--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all for this--to see it die.
<p>And thinking of that stricken one,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who weeps to-day a double loss,
<BR>Who sees a darkness o'er the sun
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by her overshadowing cross--
<BR>And thinking how her poor arms ache--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shed some tears for her sad sake.
<p>Yet in the perfect pure sunlight--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In flowers of beauty and perfume,
<BR>I think God puts these souls so white,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And gives them back to us in bloom.
<BR>'Tis thus we have the light and flowers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;By yielding up these buds of ours.
<p>In every golden, burnished ray,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In every sweet unfolding leaf,
<BR>Sad mother, you may find to-day
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some little solace in your grief.
<BR>God lets them comfort you this wise,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Until you join them in the skies.
<H3><A id="CHARLIE">IN MEMORY OF CHARLIE SPAULDING.</A></H3>
<p class="centered">Aged 6 years and 5 months; died July 4, 1875.
<p>With eyes that scarce can see for tears,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We look back o'er the little space
<BR>Of baby Charlie's life. Six years
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since first we looked upon his face.
<p>Six years since from the angel band
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our little cherub strayed away.
<BR>We did not know or understand
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He was but lent, and could not stay.
<p>We looked into his lovely eyes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So large, so soulful, and so deep,
<BR>And knew he came from God's own skies,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought that he was ours to keep.
<p>But angels missed him 'round the Throne
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere his earthly years were seven,
<BR>Christ called him, leaving us alone,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn our sorrowing hearts to Heaven.
<p>For now, no matter what may come,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wealth, fortune, honors, earthly bliss,
<BR>No place can seem to us like home,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereafter save where Charlie is.
<p>Life could not grow so warm, so bright,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No circumstances bring such joy,
<BR>But that our thoughts each morn and night
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would turn to Heaven and our boy.
<p>The thought that we may meet him there,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And walk with him the heavenly plain
<BR>Alone can keep us from despair,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring us comfort in our pain.
<p>For Arthur, who is left below,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are many thorny paths to tread.
<BR>His lips must drink of grief and woe;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so with Charlie, who is dead.
<p>For Arthur there must be, at best,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many an hour of gloom and sorrow;
<BR>For Charlie, dwelling with the blest,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy only, through an endless morrow.
<p>Walking the golden streets above,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He watches o'er us ever more.
<BR>God grant through Christ's redeeming love,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We yet may meet him on that shore.
<p>The thought of death is very sweet--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave can have no chill or gloom
<BR>For those who have a child to meet
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond in fields of living bloom.
